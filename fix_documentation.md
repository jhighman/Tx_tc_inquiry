# Parser Fix Documentation

## Issue

The parser was not correctly identifying inmate names that appeared within charge descriptions. Specifically, when a name like "WYATT, JOSH" appeared in the middle of a charge description, it was not being recognized as a new inmate record.

## Root Cause

The parser was only looking for name patterns at the beginning of lines when in the CAPTURE_CHARGES state. It was not detecting names that appeared within charge descriptions, which could happen when multiple inmate records were concatenated in the PDF extraction process.

## Solution

We enhanced the parser to detect names embedded within charge descriptions by:

1. Adding new regex patterns to detect names anywhere in a line, not just at the beginning:
   ```python
   NAME_REGEX_EMBEDDED_STRICT = re.compile(r"(?P<last>[A-Z][A-Z\-\.' ]+),\s+(?P<firstmid>[A-Z][A-Z\-\.' ]+)")
   NAME_REGEX_EMBEDDED_TOLERANT = re.compile(r"(?P<last>[A-Za-z][A-Za-z\-\.' ]+),\s+(?P<firstmid>[A-Za-z][A-Za-z\-\.' ]+)")
   ```

2. Modifying the CAPTURE_CHARGES state to check for embedded names in lines that don't match booking patterns:
   ```python
   # Check if this line starts with a name pattern
   name_match_at_start = name_regex.match(line)
   if name_match_at_start:
       # Handle name at beginning of line
       ...
   else:
       # Check for embedded names
       name_match_embedded = name_regex_embedded.search(line)
       if name_match_embedded and (name_match_embedded.start() == 0 or line[name_match_embedded.start()-1].isspace()):
           # Handle embedded name
           ...
   ```

3. Adding logic to extract identifier and book-in date from the text following an embedded name:
   ```python
   # If there's content after the name, add it to the address
   if name_match_embedded.end() < len(line):
       rest = line[name_match_embedded.end():].strip()
       if rest:
           # Check if the rest contains identifier and date
           id_date_match = ID_DATE_REGEX.search(rest)
           if id_date_match:
               current_record["identifier"] = id_date_match.group("id")
               current_record["book_in_date"] = normalize_date(id_date_match.group("date"))
               
               # If there's content after the ID/date, add it to the address
               if id_date_match.end() < len(rest):
                   addr = rest[id_date_match.end():].strip()
                   if addr:
                       current_record["address"].append(addr)
           else:
               current_record["address"].append(rest)
   ```

## Testing

We created test cases to verify the fix:

1. A simple test case with "WYATT, JOSH" as a separate record
2. A complex test case with "WYATT, JOSH" embedded in a charge description

The tests confirmed that the parser now correctly identifies "WYATT, JOSH" as a separate record in both cases.

## Results

The fixed parser now correctly identifies all inmate records, including those that appear within charge descriptions. This ensures that all inmates are properly extracted and represented in the output files.

## Impact

This fix ensures that all inmate records are correctly extracted from the PDF reports, improving the accuracy and completeness of the data. It also prevents data loss and ensures that all charges are correctly associated with the right inmates.
