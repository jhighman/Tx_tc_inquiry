# Arrest Record Parser Improvements - Final Summary

## Overview

We've significantly enhanced the arrest record parser to correctly handle the columnar layout of the PDF and properly separate address information from charges. The improvements focus on three key areas:

1. **PDF Extraction with Layout Awareness**: Added columnar layout detection to preserve the visual structure of the PDF
2. **Enhanced State Machine Logic**: Improved the parser to better handle different record patterns and embedded names
3. **Post-Processing Cleanup**: Added post-processing to fix any remaining issues with addresses and charges

## Key Improvements

### 1. PDF Extraction with Layout Awareness

The original parser treated the PDF as a simple sequence of text lines, losing the columnar layout information. We've enhanced the PDF extraction to:

- Extract text with position information to detect columns
- Identify column boundaries based on character positions
- Reconstruct the text in a way that preserves the visual layout
- Process columnar data to separate different types of information

```python
def extract_text_with_layout(page) -> str:
    """
    Extract text from a PDF page with layout awareness.
    
    This function extracts text while preserving the columnar layout of the PDF.
    It uses character position information to determine columns and reconstruct
    the text in a way that respects the visual layout.
    """
    # Extract character objects with position information
    chars = page.chars
    
    # Determine column boundaries by analyzing x-positions
    # Group characters by line (y-position)
    # Process each line with column awareness
    # ...
```

### 2. Enhanced State Machine Logic

We've improved the state machine to better handle different record patterns:

#### CAPTURE_ADDRESS State Improvements

- Added better detection of address lines (street address, city/state/zip, apartment/unit)
- Added detection of booking numbers within address lines
- Improved handling of ID and date information

```python
# Regex for detecting address lines (city, state, zip)
ADDRESS_REGEX = re.compile(r"^[A-Za-z0-9\s\.,#\-']+\s+[A-Z]{2}\s+\d{5}(-\d{4})?$")
# Regex for detecting street address lines
STREET_ADDRESS_REGEX = re.compile(r"^[0-9]+\s+[A-Za-z0-9\s\.,#\-']+$")
# Regex for detecting apartment/unit numbers
APT_REGEX = re.compile(r"^(APT|UNIT|#)\s*[A-Z0-9\-]+$", re.IGNORECASE)
```

#### CAPTURE_CHARGES State Improvements

- Added detection of address lines within charge descriptions
- Improved handling of embedded names in charge descriptions
- Added detection of booking numbers within charge descriptions

```python
# Check if this is an address line (city, state, zip)
elif ADDRESS_REGEX.match(line):
    logger.debug(f"Found address line in charges section, starting new record: {line}")
    
    # This is likely a new record without a proper name line
    # Check if we can find a name in the previous charge description
    if current_record["charges"]:
        last_charge_desc = current_record["charges"][-1]["description"]
        name_match_in_desc = name_regex_embedded.search(last_charge_desc)
        
        if name_match_in_desc:
            # Extract the name from the charge description
            # Update the charge description to remove the name
            # Finalize the current record
            # Start a new record with the extracted name
            # ...
```

### 3. Post-Processing Cleanup

We've added post-processing to fix any remaining issues:

```python
def post_process_records(records: List[Record]) -> List[Record]:
    """
    Post-process records to fix any remaining issues.
    """
    cleaned_records = []
    
    for record in records:
        # Clean up the record
        cleaned_record = clean_record(record)
        
        # Add the cleaned record to the list
        cleaned_records.append(cleaned_record)
    
    return cleaned_records
```

#### Clean Address

```python
def clean_address(address: List[str], charges: List[Dict[str, str]]) -> List[str]:
    """
    Clean up address lines by removing booking numbers and charge descriptions.
    """
    # Check if lines contain booking numbers
    # Check if lines are valid address lines
    # Check if lines contain embedded names
    # ...
```

#### Clean Charges

```python
def clean_charges(charges: List[Dict[str, str]], address: List[str]) -> List[Dict[str, str]]:
    """
    Clean up charges by removing address lines from charge descriptions.
    """
    # Check if descriptions contain address patterns
    # Check if descriptions contain embedded names
    # ...
```

## Testing

We've created comprehensive tests to verify the improvements:

1. **Unit Tests**: Tests for each record pattern, including embedded names
2. **Sample Data Test**: A test script that processes a sample file with embedded names
3. **Real PDF Test**: A test script that processes real PDF files and generates statistics

```python
def print_statistics(records: List[Record]) -> None:
    """
    Print statistics about the extracted records.
    """
    # Count records with missing fields
    # Count records with warnings
    # Count total charges
    # Print the most common warnings
    # ...
```

## Benefits

These improvements ensure:

1. **Complete Record Extraction**: All inmate records are correctly identified, even when embedded in charge descriptions
2. **Accurate Address Extraction**: Address lines are properly separated from charges
3. **Clean Charge Descriptions**: Charge descriptions don't contain address information or embedded names
4. **Robust Error Handling**: Warnings are added for malformed records, but processing continues

## Usage

To test the improved parser with a real PDF sample:

```bash
./test_real_samples.py --pdf path/to/sample.pdf --out-dir ./out
```

This will generate:
- `out/arrests.json`: JSON file with the extracted records
- `out/arrests.csv`: CSV file with the extracted records (one row per charge)
- Statistics about the extracted records

## Conclusion

The enhanced parser now correctly handles the columnar layout of the PDF and properly separates address information from charges. This ensures complete and accurate extraction of arrest records from county jail "book-in" PDF reports.
