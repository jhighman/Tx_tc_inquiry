## Dependencies and Critical Path

The critical path for this project is:

1. Project Setup → Data Model → PDF I/O → Parser → Writers → CLI → Testing
2. MongoDB Integration can be developed in parallel with CLI
3. Web Retrieval and Backup depend on Parser and Writers
4. Documentation can be developed incrementally throughout

## Resource Allocation

- 1 Senior Developer (full-time)
- 1 QA Engineer (part-time, for testing phases)
- Access to MongoDB instance for integration testing
- Sample PDFs for development and testing

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| PDF format changes | High | Medium | Design for extensibility, monitor for changes |
| OCR quality issues | Medium | Medium | Fallback patterns, warning system |
| Performance with large PDFs | Medium | Low | Incremental processing, optimization |
| MongoDB scaling | Medium | Low | Proper indexing, connection pooling |
| Network reliability for web retrieval | Medium | Medium | Robust error handling, retries |
| Disk space for backups | Low | Medium | Retention policy, monitoring |

## Success Criteria

1. System correctly extracts records from all test PDFs
2. Performance meets requirements (processing time < 5 seconds per page)
3. All tests pass with > 90% coverage
4. Documentation is complete and accurate
5. Backup mechanism reliably preserves historical data
6. MongoDB integration successfully stores and retrieves records
